# DoLis

## Description: 
As part of my studies, I developed an interactive web application "dolis" using Django, Bootstrap, Heroku, and PostgreSQL to enhance meetings and events. The app serves as a platform for attendees to engage in real-time, making it a clone of popular event interaction tool "Slido". My role in this project was to design and implement the full-stack solution, providing a seamless experience for users to participate in meetings and events.
